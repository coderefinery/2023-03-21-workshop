  title: 1.2 Git Intro
  description: >
    Here, we go over the basics of git from first principles, though
    this is not the most basic course you can find.  We cover basics,
    motivation, making commits, undoing things, staging.  The part 2
    video goes into branching and merging, conflict resolution,
    inspecting history, basics of sharing repositories online, and
    some practical advice.  However, this does not cover multi-user
    work or remotes (that is the next lesson, git-collaborative).

    There are two external videos which are excluded from this
    recording.  You can find the link to them in the table of contents

#    If you can't get your code to do the same thing again, is it

#    work?  Reproducibilty is a big deal, but we don't always learn how
#    to do it.  In this lesson, we cover the basics, how to organize
#    projects, record computational steps with Snakemake or other
#    workflow managers, how to record environments with conda (and docker
#    a bit), and sharing code and data (FAIR).

#    support this?  Our work is a constant balance between using the
#    work of others and hoping that others will use our work.  In this
#    lesson, we talk about the advantages and disadvantages of others
#    building on our work, and how to support that.

#    documentation to Read the Docs service.

#    anyone can do it. This is a crash course for scientists to get
#    started testing their software.
#
#    Tools covered include concepts of testing for science, unit
#    testing, pytest, continuous integration, and GitHub actions.  We
#    make demos in Python, but have examples in other languages and
#    this will apply to every language in some form.

#    In this live-coding demo session we take a Python script as
#    starting point which reads data, computes simple statistics, and
#    generates a plot. Together we then improve this code based on
#    suggestions from the audience to arrive at a more reusable code
#    with reusable components. We start in the Jupyter notebook, later
#    move to a Python script/module, introduce testing, and finally
#    introduce and motivate a command line interface to our code.
#
#    In this demonstration we use JupyterLab, Python, Pandas,
#    Matplotlib, pytest, and Click.  It is also a great demonstration
#    of pair programming.
