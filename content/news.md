### News

- Day 5 news / prep for day 6:
  - We covered the things on the schedule: Jupyter and Documentation.
    Overall, it went well, though there are a few things to read
    yourself later.
  - Today seemed to have the most problems getting things to work.
    Perhaps this is expected, because it had both Git usage (pushing
    to Github, making repositories, and so on) and the conda
    environment.  We didn't have time to go over all of these in
    detail again today (we tried to earlier or in the install
    instructions), so we recommend you talk with local partners or
    other support to work out these things.
  - Day 5 is a really cool day, where we go over testing (a very
    useful lesson that connects everything together), and modular code
    development, a fun way to watch a whole project be built and
    slowly adopt better practices.
