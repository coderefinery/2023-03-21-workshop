### News

- Day 1 Q&A has been posted (you can ask follow up questions tomorrow
  during the icebreaker or overnight).
- Day 1 wrap-up:
  - We covered [git-intro](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/),
    parts "Motivation", "Basics", "Branching and merging", and "Conflict
    resolution".  This is the basics of all the rest, so review if you
    need to (review links above).
  - We continue with git-intro tomorrow, and show even more advanced
    and useful things (until we work together on day 3).  You can join
    with no problems tomorrow if you didn't join today (you'll be
    assumed to know the basic git commands we discussed today - review
    the lesson above for details).
  - Check [install/configuration
    instructions](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/) if
    anything went wrong today.
  - See you tomorrow!

- Automatic confirmation emails sometimes go to spam. We will email a summary to all registrants before the workshop.
