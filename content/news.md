### News

- Day 3 exercises: Also individual learners can participate in the collaborative
  exercises ([instructions](@/communication/summary-day2+prep-day3.md))
- Day 2 news:
  - We covered [git-intro](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/),
    parts "Sharing repositories online", "Inspecting history",
    "Undoing and recovering", and "Practical advice: how much git is
    necessary?".  We especially build on the "sharing" lesson more in
    future days, starting tomorrow.
  - We had lots of problems with SSH keys and connecting to GitHub.
    Today was somewhat of a practice - if you saw problems, you have
    time to fix before it's important tomorrow! Check the
    [installation
    instructions](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/),
    especially [SSH connection to GitHub](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/ssh/)
    and verify!
