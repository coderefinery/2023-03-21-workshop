### News

- Day 4 news / prep for day 5:
  - We covered the things said in the schedule: Reproducible Research
    and Social Coding.
  - There isn't much prep for tomorrow, other than making sure the
    CodeRefinery conda environment is installed.  Drop-ins are still
    welcome and there is nothing from day 4 you need to know.
