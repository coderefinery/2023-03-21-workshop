### News

- Day 3 news / prep for day 4:
  - We covered
    [git-collaborative](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/),
    all of the core episodes. We managed to merge in contributions
    from at least 50 people, if not a hundred!  You can follow up by
    trying the exercises yourself: either with a friend, or by
    yourself (you can be both the "team leader/maintainer" and
    "contributor", it still works.)
  - **You need to check the software installation and configuration
    for week 2!**  If anything did not go well today (SSH connection
    to GitHub in particular), you should figure that out, or else you
    have problems next week.  We will start using the
    [CodeRefinery conda environment the](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/).
  - It is OK to join next week if you didn't join first week.  We will
    assume a knowledge of Git, but there are probably many people for
    whom this is relevant.  Invite your friends and all.
  - See you next week!
