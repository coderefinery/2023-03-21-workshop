### News

- Day 3 exercises: We are fine-tuning the setup and will send information
  to all Wednesday early afternoon CET.
- Day 1 Q&A has been posted (you can ask follow up questions tomorrow
  during the icebreaker or overnight).
- Day 2 news:
  - We covered [git-intro](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/),
    parts "Sharing repositories online", "Inspecting history",
    "Undoing and recovering", and "Practical advice: how much git is
    necessary?".  We especially build on the "sharing" lesson more in
    future days, starting tomorrow.
  - We had lots of problems with ssh keys and connecting to GitHub.
    Today was somewhat of a practice - if you saw problems, you have
    time to fix before it's important tomorrow!  Check the
    [installation
    instructions](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/),
    especially
    [https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/ssh/#ssh](SSH
    connection to Github) and verify!
