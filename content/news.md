### News

- Day 1 wrap-up:
  - We covered [git-intro](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/),
    parts "Motivation, Basics, "branching and merging", and "conflict
    resolution".  This is the basics of all the rest, so review if you
    need to (review links above).
  - We continue with git-intro tomorrow, and show even more advanced
    and useful things (until we work together on day 3).
  - Check [install/configuration
    instructions](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/) if
    anything went wrong today.
  - See you tomorrow!

- Automatic confirmation emails sometimes go to spam. We will email a summary to all registrants before the workshop.
