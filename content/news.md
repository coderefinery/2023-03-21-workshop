### News

- Day 3 news / prep for day 4:
  - We covered
    [git-collaborative](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/),
    all of the core episodes.  We managed to merge in contributions
    from at least 50 people, if not a hundred!  You can follow up by
    trying the exercises yourself: either with a friend, or by
    yourself (you can be both the "team leader/maintainer" and
    "contributor", it still works.)
  - **You need to check the software installation and configuration
    for week 2!**  If anything did not go well today (SSH connection
    to Github in particular), you should figure that out, or else you
    have problems next week.  We also start using the **CodeRefinery
    conda environment**, which we didn't this week.  [Check the
    instructions](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/).
  - It is OK to join next week if you didn't join this week.  We will
    assume a knowledge of git, but there are probably many people for
    whom this is relevant.  Invite your friends and all.
  - See you next week!
- Day 2 news:
  - We covered [git-intro](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/),
    parts "Sharing repositories online", "Inspecting history",
    "Undoing and recovering", and "Practical advice: how much git is
    necessary?".  We especially build on the "sharing" lesson more in
    future days, starting tomorrow.
  - We had lots of problems with SSH keys and connecting to GitHub.
    Today was somewhat of a practice - if you saw problems, you have
    time to fix before it's important tomorrow! Check the
    [installation
    instructions](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/),
    especially [SSH connection to GitHub](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/ssh/)
    and verify!
