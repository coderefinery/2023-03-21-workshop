Dear CodeRefinery workshop partipant,

We continue the event tomorrow (Thu) at 08:50 CET (UTC+01)!

Please find summary of Day 2 in https://coderefinery.github.io/2023-03-21-workshop/#news

On Thursday we will all practice how to collaborate using Git/GitHub
and one ambitious thing we will try is to collaborate with
participants following via stream.

- Everybody: Make sure you have SSH connection configured (but please still come and watch even if it does not work)
- Learners in teams and exercise groups: nothing to prepare yet (you can skip rest of email)
- Individual learners who wish to actively participate: please read below and request access
- Team leads: You can prepare the exercise repositories tomorrow following https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/centralized/#exercise-preparation and https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/distributed/#exercise-preparation

If you would like to participate **as individual learner** actively in the collaborative
exercises, please request access by opening an issue at https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/access-requests/issues/new/choose (There click "Get started" -> "Submit new issue")

This way we will know your GitHub username and give you write access to exercise repositories.

After we add you as collaborator, you will get an email from GitHub.
- Please accept the invitation
- Don't forget to "unwatch" both https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/centralized-workflow-exercise and https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/centralized-workflow-exercise-recorded
- Screenshot how to "unwatch" at https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/centralized/#exercise-preparation

See you tomorrow!

CodeRefinery team
