Dear CodeRefinery workshop partipant,

We start the event tomorrow at 08:50 CET (UTC+01)!

Since some registration confirmation emails go to spam, we decided to send a summary to all registrants just to make sure you have them:

The workshop will stream at https://twitch.tv/coderefinery (no Twitch account needed)
Our collaborative document (Q&A): [please register to get it â€“ check your spam folder for confirmation email]
Summary of links at the workshop page: https://coderefinery.github.io/2023-03-21-workshop/#quick-links
All emails that we send out can also be found at https://coderefinery.github.io/2023-03-21-workshop/communication/

We wish you all a happy and educating workshop! On behalf of the CodeRefinery team,

Radovan and Matias
